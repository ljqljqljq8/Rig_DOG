## Introduction

- RIG-puppy (Lulu) is a miniature quadruped robot platform designed for education, makers, and embedded AI enthusiasts.
Powered by the ESP32-S3 chip as the main controller, it integrates the domestic open-source AI voice framework “XiaoZhi,” enabling a fully local closed-loop pipeline including voice wake-up, natural language understanding, and action execution.
Unlike common four-DOF robotic dogs, RIG-puppy innovatively uses five bus-style UART servos to build a 5-DOF motion structure. A waist servo is introduced, and UART bus communication greatly simplifies wiring complexity, making the robot structurally clean and allowing richer and more interesting movements.
